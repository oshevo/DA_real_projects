"This educator immediately reminds me of my favourite teacher of all time. I was 14 in 9th grade in New Delhi, and the teacher was Mr Atri and he taught us Mathematics. An absolutely brilliant man, and an amazingly intriguing teacher who taught me mathematical concepts, that I still remember to this day, and I'm almost 35 years old now."

Right now im at 24:05 till now so much of tqlk with bad jokes as a distraction just teach what i came for man
"Wow, it was all so clear and well explained! I even laugh a lot with your jokes.
Nice job Craig!"
"I was stuck at 1:41:52 . I needed to uncheck ""Disable Inherit Values""."
THANK YOU!!

"Unfortunately I was unable to do the Twilio part as Twilio has blocked my account right after registration. They sent me an email asking to provide the reason why I'm using their service. After my honest reply that I'm just learning API and a reference to this video, they said they couldn't restore my account because my ""use case is not supported by their service"". The video is still very useful and easy to watch, thank you!"
You are Wonderful! Thank You for blessing Us all with Your wisdom and Expertise.
Please stop with humor
BALD MRBEAST!!
"I don't know how to code yet. I am a bit lost in this video. Yes, he dresses it up nicely .. but .. not sure if he is really happy in all that mess. Maybe he is."

"I'm so hyped, and that teacher hypes me even more! Explations superb!"
"Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much, you are a fantastic teacher!"
;-;
"Great teacher, but I wish so many of the examples weren't done with something so ""connected."" Tons of verification required for using Twilio, which really slows things down. Twilio verification changes in November 2023 made it impossible to actually execute those examples as a hobbyist/student. If you've got some experience in development, you can adapt these examples as needed; but for novices it may be a bit more difficult to follow along than was promised."
"I am using Windows 11 and I can not see any of the Spotify stuff you are teaching, it only work on MAC OS?"
Worked up to 4ku on codewars learning to functionally program around small isolated problems and then ran into an API project and have no idea where to start. Forums and searches led me here. It's weird feeling like you learned something only to realize you can't do anything useful with it. Hoping this video helps! (edit on the way).
why this guy looks like MR. BEAST father
So API = function?
Woke agenda in this tutorial!
"This is great!! I am struggling in the Spotify part with the Oauth, like Dennis mentioned, the UI has changed in the dev section. 
Has anyone been successful with the Oauth part? I keep getting a 400 error."
Definitely a tutorial to watch for learning with immersive experience.
I do like the fact that freecodecamp gives us these informations for free BUT I just can't stop getting annoyed by the fact that Craig Dennis used twillio api which is the company that he works for. It's like promoting yourself. I would not care if it was a free api but it is not and it's not worth the hassle. Don't get me wrong in anyway I am grateful for this course but wish he would have used a free api which would give us a tool in our repository instead of an api we will only use for 10 - 15 messages give or take.

Very informative! thank you !
"for those wondering what was that on 10:22:

it's in ruby language, 
chr(ord('y') ^ 0x20):

1. ord('y') : The `ord` method in Ruby returns the ASCII code of the character passed to it. In this case, `ord('y')` returns the ASCII code for the character 'y', which is 121.

2. 0x20 : This represents the hexadecimal value 20, which is equivalent to 32 in decimal.

3. `^` (XOR operator): The XOR (exclusive OR) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of two numbers.

4. ord('y') ^ 0x20 This bitwise XOR operation is performed between the ASCII code of 'y' (121 in decimal) and 32. The result is 89.

5. chr(89):  The `chr` method in Ruby converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character. In this case, `chr(89)` returns the character with the ASCII code 89, which is 'Y'.

So, the overall expression `chr(ord('y') ^ 0x20)` takes the character 'y', performs a bitwise XOR with 32, resulting in the ASCII code 89, and then converts that ASCII code back to the character 'Y'."

Curl for Spotify doesn't work for me. I have 'invalid access token' error. Why?
DI (Developer Interface-as opposed to UI) is better than API.
I wish your video will also be available in multiple languages like Hindi. I find difficult in understanding in English.

"Great Course! I was trying to follow along with the Spotify example, and I cannot find the Spotify Web API console. I found a post in the Spotify community where someone was asking where the console was, but there was no response. Does anyone know how to access the console if it is still available?"
"Unfortunately it looks like Spotify have changed their web developer user interface (in the UK at least) and the process for getting started with using Spotify's API is very different to how it looks in this tutorial. There is no longer a console that you can access from your browser, you have to install multiple ""packages"" locally on your machine.

Spotify have made a tutorial (spread over a dizzying number of hyperlinked pages) to build an app. So in order to do the first tutorial for this video which requires the console, I went through some of the process (not knowing what I was installing or what I was doing) to try and get a command line environment that accesses Spotify's API, and eventually gave up. It didn't seem like that process was going to get me to a point where I could do the exercise in the video! :( 

Maybe Spotify view having their own tutorial as an even more accessible developer environment, but it made following this video impossible for me."
Thanks!

"Youre superior for creating this hosting video! Ive experimented with HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupn is the best cash saver."
I was summonded for jury duty on the day I was supposed to start a new gig.  I had to explain what an API was to the judge.  My little wheels were churning so I didn't sound condescending but explained it enough.  I came up with the Rosetta Stone translations that couldn't all be stored on a phone so API calls from a little phone app would be made to a website or cloud repository.
Thanks for the amazing video!
Awesome and Lively presentation

Best teacher everrrr
55:55 did end up being so funny because i zoned out and back in and you were still talking about 'who runs the terminal' curl beyonce link. ha but i wont forget that link now either.
"When I copy the request sample from Spotify, it's not working in CMD"
Thankyou So much.
"Thanks for the good web hosting knowledge! Ive examined HostGator and GoDaddy, however Cloudways with TST20 coupon is the budget-friendly selection."
spotify console is no longer here so following along is really hard
i cant get an accces token to run the code in my terminal !!
"43:46 just here to say that the line on Beyonce taking the API dev to red lobster wasn't lost in the crack, clever wordplay ;)"
42:58
who runs the terminal?
you are or Male or Female. thats it.
9:35 APIs are like functions that could be called over the internet.
"I think the API is updated, and now to get the token, we must already create our app, to get the token :("
Exploring Spotify API and my token is being shortened.. How can I fix that.
My curl get request isn't working in the terminal..everything seems to have changed since the time upload of this course... The token is incomplete. How can I fix that
"I couldn't get the Twillio command line code to work, and kept giving the error message that no credentials provided. Twillo must have changed regarding using a test account in command line, because the support materials state that ""Twilio test credentials will not work with Twilio CLI"". Otherwise, I agree that this is a good course. I know things do not remain the same and get changed sometimes."
Did anyone have any issues trying to find Console on Spotify. Wanted to follow along but I guess Spotify updated and I could not follow along
The Spotify dev page has changed considerably and feel its extremely difficult to follow this class now.

"I can't do the Spotify Web API from my terminal because it hides the access token. Even when i hit the copy button on spotify, it still doesn't give me the complete token and then says ""invalid access token"" for the error reason. The interface has changed quite a bit since this video. There wasn't anywhere to create the token, and it certainly doesn't look like the one in the video. So none of this works for me."
You cannot - prove any API - with TTY!

"The spotify developer CONSOLE isn't currently available from Jan 2023...
Please update the course :)"
Very good content by the way!! I found it hard to learn elsewhere the new tech since last 13 years. Recently I got my visa approved for Canada and I m looking to move there. I heard they have more requirement for this skillset in combination with mainframe. Could you please elaborate how mainframe use restapi as a front end. I think I heard you saying api is always backend so what is my company implying by using backend data with involvement of z/os connect and postman. We use 3270 mainframe systems and 3270 online (front end system). I heard they implemented  a system fix by using Cics cobol program by sending some data to Cics and that data I guess was pulled by z/os somehow and it was getting rendered on a website in form of something. Looked like someone created a restapi services using postman and this new api was accessing data from what was printed on a Cics job running in queue online during the day when the developer test his changes which is sort of making sense now.can you help me understand if I m understanding it right ?

Feedback: Please mention about windows not needing the backslashes in the terminal earlier. You mention it around 1:07:30 when it would have been better to mention it before actually copying and pasting cURL stuff into the terminal
My bookmark 23:57
"49:54
I'm stuck at this part as Spotify changed how to get access to authorization token. You have to run a curl command but when I copy and paste in into my terminal, changing the necessary parameters as needed (Client ID and Client Secret) it doesn't work (I'm on Windows btw. I made sure that curl is installed. It is)
What am I doing wrong?

Edit: Nevermind I got it to work. Its a bit annoying that the text editor I'm using (Notepad++) to post the copied code into first to be able to make changes to the parameters, doesn't allow me to copy and paste the code from the text editor to the terminal. I have to get rid of any newline characters. If anyone more experienced then me can give me some good text editors to work  in, please let me know :)"

"Came here because everything in the cloud is an API call. Anyway don't mind me just making myself some notes:

Interfaces provide a way of using/interacting with sth
API allow programs/programmers to use stuff without knowing the implementation for common enough tasks"
"The teacher earns my attention from the first second. this video was recommended by youtube and i am so excited! I am learning python, and why not to take a course on api's by a great instructor? so excited! Your students and your family must be proud of you. I have take so many online courses, i have to say you have the best way of teaching. Thank you"

What should i watch first https method video or this API one
But where is the developer console? Has it been renamed or what? I'm stuck.
"Hey everyone, unfortunately he is right about the Spotify page being different. Problem is, they've removed the ability to generate authentication tokens and curl statements in the browser and while still possible, it's a much more difficult process. I'd recommend just watching the Spotify part and then jumping in at the Twilio part."
Need free ecommerce api with multiple categories and products

I cannot find the console page in Spotify developer page.
This guy is amazing. I am wondering how he makes study so enjoyable. I want my kid has teachers like him. Even breaks are included. Wow.
Brought to you by twillio lol
"That was a great course. Enjoyed it so much. 
I am curious if it is also possible to receive a certificate after testing our new knowledge of this course?"
I don't understand a word this guy is saying
There should have been projects in course to build along making apps sending and getting api requests

"I keep getting this message when I tried to install Curl on my Mac "" curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404"" any help on how to proceed will be appreciated, thanks"
just 10 min into this video and I fell in love with his teaching. WOW
"great tutorial, I've had fun the whole time while learning but I'm trying to use Twilio and phone number verification is not going through, I am in Nigeria, please is there a workaround for this challenge?"
"Good teacher, bad course material!
- Spotify API is changing so fast, that I could not find the curl requests you show on the current Spotify site.
- Twilio might be a cool website, but no way I give my Number and E-Mail to try it. 
- You explained really good at the start, but then you started talking mostly about the company you work for (twilio) and things that are not important.

Honest review: 2 of 10, and 2 is only for the sense of humor..."
"This course is amazing, but since it was creating Spotify recently updated their entire Developers section and the console is missing entirely and I can't figure out how to get the oauth token. 
Anyone figured this out yet?"
its okay
"Great tutorial, but sadly Console is gone with Spotify. :("
"Hey folks, can I know what has been deprecated?"
I love this class! Anyone else getting a 502 Error for the Twilio Developer Documentation?
I just cant understand how to use curl with windows!!
"if gender is not a problem, why did they ask"
"Craig is a very fun and enjoyable instructor, but this whole video is pretty much a ___ Twilio ad___

 I signed up and used it once to send SMS, but not likely to use it again. I did watch whole video, made notes."
Amazing way of teaching!!
why as a developer you cannot afford a better quality microphone

Yes it definitely is! I love this man. Made learning so funful and enjoyable. You just can't skip any part. I rewind when I miss a single statement. Thanks a bunch for letting him teach. ‚ù§"
spotify changed its configuration completely and now i am completely lost .... :) seems waaaayyy more complicated to get a token ! i am sooo lost omg :(
is it just me or it IS impossible to go on Twilio ? i have been trying to create an account multiple time with different email and everytime i try to sign in the page refresh over and over again and tell e there is an error. i did try to reply to trilio's message when they sent an email about verifying my identity to protect them of fraud but they never replied back ! and my account is still blocked ! and when i try to create a new account it does the same thing again!
I have no idea how to request oauth token from this new Spotify UI. It seems like we are required to have an app with URI provided. Anyone has any clue?
"the guy is a truly righteous and son of god, he deserves heaven"
You are a brilliant and gifted educator. Thank you
"bruhhh, this guy is soo fun."
"I have not decided if this is a good course or not. For instance, I thought the speaker was saying 'restbox'. There is a 'restbox' out there but does not do what his did. I played him saying it over and over. After reading the notes, I learned he was saying 'restfox'. He needs to speak SLOWER and enunciate clearly. One should not have to rewind over and over again just to get a simple point."

I wasnt able to find this console thing on Spotify at all
"This course has been an incredibly fruitful experience for me, and I can confidently say that it's one of the best things I've ever done in my life. As someone who has been programming for almost a decade, gaining a deep understanding of how APIs work has taken my skills to a whole new level.

I'm truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course, and I want to express my appreciation to those who made it possible. This is exactly how education should be: interactive, engaging, and straight to the point. The practical, hands-on approach of the course has allowed me to learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively, and I'm confident that the knowledge I've gained will prove invaluable in my future endeavors. Thank you again for creating such a fantastic learning experience."

"Sorry if this has already been addressed, but I am stuck at 1:57 because I am on windows and neither the Linux or the windows options worked to load the environment credentials.  Anyone else have this problem and maybe a hint what to do?  Great video btw, thank you!"
Thank you so much. I learned a lot about APIs from this course.
"1 - This such a great great class, I'm following everything and learning gobs since I've been out of the programming world for 10 years.
2 - Small issue on setting up RestFox to send the DVD picture.  No matter what I did it would not send.  My final troubleshooting step was to send a very small picture, and that worked.
Is there a size restriction causing an issue or am I using the wrong URL?  What is the URL?  It is not in the notes...
3 - The notes for Unit 2 Video 4 are very very sparse, can they be touched up?"
"spotify apis are only available for the US, UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia markets ??"
I got completely lost at Unit 2 Video 4 @ postman/rest fox....I guess I'll give your first video tutorial I see others mentioning a try
"Perfect video for API, thanks, Dennis!"

"I learned about this concept in school but it was only briefly covered in a database class and I never understood the point of it until my last job. They were manually configuring hundreds of appliance-type devices through their web UI's which took hours of work. One small change request was many more hours of work again. I realized that these appliances had an API and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of IP's and sent API commands to each device in the list. I did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half. 

As someone who is in IT but is not a developer, even I could see the enormous power and potential of the API. It opens the door to automation, which reduces human error dramatically. It also speeds up onboarding. I am looking forward to watching this course and learning more about API's and their other uses."
how do you send message at 2:35:32
Awsome vid... I can only thank you for your effort and time by delivering this amazing tutorial.
Best api course ever. I never saw any teachers make learning course enjoyable as much as Craig Dennis. He even teach people to take their time to relax and think.

I really loved the breaks and the things you did to keep the learning interesting throughout the video. I wish we had more trainers / teachers like you! You rock!

WOW !!! Your Voice sounds like All THREE STOOGES wrapped into one with all sort of Up and down range in tone.  You gloss over a plethora of terms and really explain NONE of the actual terms and yet you think we should somehow know what you are talking about FOR BEGINNERS .  Perhaps all of your FRIENDS who commented here to boost your rating or Seasoned Programmers who have already a good general understanding of all this UNDERSTANDS what you are talking about.  I have watched the first 30 minutes  3 TIMES IN A ROW ( thats an hour and a half of Gibberish ) and I have NO IDEA ZERO IDEA of what you are even talking about.

Am I misunderstanding something or you need an American phone number to be able to send to your Twilio phone number in the trial and follow along with this?

This is a great course ü•∞ .... but the problem i face all the time is that Twilio restrict me from getting a Twilio number ....My first account suspended by them after 1 second i created it......  After that I created another account with another email but they restrict me from  getting a Twilio number.... Also no replies to emails...Now i am stressed ü§ïabout this struggle...I was not able continue this course for two days because this issue... Feel like to give up this tutorialüò•....is there a alternative to Twilio for following this course?
WATCH THIS VIDEO YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!! Such an amazing teacher! Thank you for such a wonderful course!
"When I open the url for ""who runs the world"" search in the browser, it just opens the Beyonc√© page, but not the song itself. I noticed that when he does the first search at 54:46, even though it brings up the wrong artist page, the Beyonc√© song is there already at the bottom of the page - I guess because that‚Äôs the last song played on his Spotify profile. So that when he then puts in the correct url at 55:40, it brings up Beyonc√©‚Äôs main page, but the same song is still there. Did anyone else have this happen to them and did you manage to show the correct track that was searched for? The url itself seems to only refer to the artist, but not the search for the track. Thank you!"

"Thank you for making this free, I feel such great gratitude! ^^"
Good one!
How about I have a DHIS2 database and it doesn't have an exposed API to consume the data stored in the DHIS2. How then do you create an API to consume the data. I was thinking this is what this tutorial will be addressing and not the conventional API tutorials.
Are you using Terminal on mac? The part where you typed jq and changed colors nothing happened for me.
How does he look better than 3 years ago. Kek
Three minutes into the video and I've learned absolutely nothing about api. I doubt the next three hours will be any better. Time to cut my losses...
"I love how he teaches this guy, he reminds me of Jesse from Breaking Bad. I have understood things and learned new concepts so I see the light! Thanks!"
I just want to let him know that I actually laughed at the 'who runs the terminal? curl' joke. dad jokes ftw
Congratulations
This is the course that actually thought me how to work with API's
"I ran the same code and it returned an external URL for Rihanna's artist page. No matter which way I try it, it won't return Beyonce. Weird. Not sure what I did wrong or how it keeps connecting Rihanna from Beyonce. I don't normally listen to either so it's certainly not some stray data throwing it off."
"Absolutely love the tone and approach to this course, and thank you for making this free!"

"Please add advance modern backend development with Nodejs and Mongodb, redis with advanced aggregation and all useful npm packages"
Is replit based on API? As we can see all the server code running on browser
"I could use an API to abstract away the ""cutesy"" parts of this presentation which would cut it down at least 40% of the distractive nonsense based on what I've seen so far. I also acknowledge that this could be valuable for some people,  but not me."

"Apart the cringe humor, he is very charismatic and fluid explaining things. Thanks for the video!"
I'd prefer that Spotify not ask gender.  Why do they care about that?  It's not being inclusive.  It's intrusive marketing.  Don't be naive.
Amazing video.

"Thank you so much for sharing this with us on YouTube ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• from Kyoto üáØüáµ 

His API course is hands down the most accessible and life-changing for dummies like me"
"Definitely not for beginners and I haven't learned that much, only a few key words like REST, CRUD, CURL, POSTMAN and the course has taken 3 hours of my life...
I don't know why you're using Twilio as everything... you said Postman is complicated, Twilio is on a next level of 'complicated'...
Why not use Visual Studio Code and start from scratch using only this editor and show us how to start and finish A WORKING PROJECT. You're trying to teach about an API. So start a project in VSC, take a dad jokes API as an example and teach us how everything works. The main objective to use an API is for a website to be interactive and right now I don't even know how to implement an API on a website so I can extract a user's custom query and show that data on a website as a result...

That's the problem with tutorials right now, they're very long and not practical unfortunately."
dude you‚Äôre such an awesome instructor. i hope to one day be like you!
"I just finish his old api course, now there's an updated one?"
I really love this man's energy he makes learning not feel cumbersome at all
